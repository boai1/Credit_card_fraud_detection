# Credit card fraud detection

### Description
This repository contains the implementation of 3 Machine Learning classifiers used for the task of credit card fraud prediction. The implementation was done using a Stratified K-fold cross validation strategy. The models in question are:
- logistic regression (75% accuracy achieved)
- random forest (96% accuracy achieved)
- XGB Classifier (97% accuracy achieved)

Following the implementation, the XGB classifier was pushed to a simple web-app, using flask.
